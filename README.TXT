I am doing the figures project
Project "figures"
Authors: Michael Kölling and David J. Barnes

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition

It is discussed in chapter 1. 


This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

You can create various shapes, and you will see, if you do, that those
shapes are drawn on screen (in a window that we call the "canvas").

You can then manipulate these objects: change their position, size and 
colour. Try it out: create a few different squares, triangles and circles.

This project is designed as a first example of object-oriented programming.
It illustrates a number of concepts:

 - a Java project (application) is a collection of classes
 - objects can be created from classes
 - from any one class, many objects may be created
 - objects have operations (methods)
 - operations can have parameters
 - parameters have types (at least String and int)
 - objects hold data (fields)
 - the operations and fields are common to all objects
 - the values stored in the fields can be different for each object

The project also demonstrates

 - BlueJ object creation
 - interactive method invocation
 - parameter passing

A good second project to look at after this is "picture", which adds a class
to those ones in this project. That class (named "Picture") uses the shapes
to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with coding.
 
Tips: if I activate show terminal in view at the top I can now save what I modify with the objects

Answers: 

Part 3 

Question 2: 

When I call moveDown twice, the object that I made visible goes down two times and if I call it three times it goes down three times. When I call makeInvisible twice, the object goes invisible. 

Question 6: When I Invoke the changeColor method, and write the color into the parameter field without the quotes, it says error: cannot find symbole

 How did I recreate the house image ? 

 First of all, I made a 150 size red square and made it visible as the rest of the objects. Second of all, I added a triangle with 70 in height and 200 in wide and made it color green. Third of all, I added a square and made it size 40 and black. Fourth of all, I finilize the image by adding a circle size 90 and made it  yellow.
 
 Question 9: No, because I followed the image.
